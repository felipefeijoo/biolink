#Getting started with BioLink

= Installing a new instance of BioLink =

BioLink 3.0 can be downloaded from [http://code.google.com/p/biolink/downloads here].

== Creating a BioLink database ==

=== Installing SQL Server ===

BioLink requires a connection to a SQL Server instance. In order to attach the BioLink starter database you will need administrative privileges on the SQL Server.  If you already have administrative access to a SQL Server 2008 R2 instance, you can skip this step.

*Note:* At this time, the starter database supplied is compatible with  SQL Server 2008 R2 or greater. Existing BioLink databases running on older versions of SQL Server can be connected to using the BioLink client, however.

Download and install SQL Server 2008 R2 from http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/en/us/editions/express.aspx
