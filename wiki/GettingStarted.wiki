#Getting started with BioLink

= Installing a new instance of !BioLink =

The latest published build of !BioLink 3.0 can be downloaded from [http://code.google.com/p/biolink/downloads here].

== Creating a !BioLink database ==

=== Installing SQL Server ===

BioLink requires a connection to a SQL Server database instance. Installing a new !BioLink database is simply a matter of 'attaching' the starter database file to the SQL Server database, and then connect to it using the !BioLink application.

In order to attach the !BioLink starter database you will need administrative privileges on the SQL Server.  If you already have administrative access to a SQL Server 2008 R2 instance, you can skip this step.

*Note:* At this time, the supplied starter database is compatible with  SQL Server 2008 !R2 or greater only. Existing !BioLink databases running on older versions of SQL Server can be connected to using the !BioLink client without any issues, however.

*Download and install SQL Server 2008 R2 from http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/en/us/editions/express.aspx*

*Download and install the SQL Server Management Management Studio Express from http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8961*
