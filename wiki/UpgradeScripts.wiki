#summary Scripts that modify existing BioLink databases to work correctly with version 3.0

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

A small number of enhancements have been made to the BioLink database schema since version 2.5. In addition, an issue has been discovered in the stored procedure that is used to generate the Associates for Taxon report that can lead to incorrect or missing results, even though associates are known to exist. 

== How to execute the scripts ==

*Note:* You will need administrator access to the SQL Server instance which holds the BioLink database. You will also need Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (or some other tool for executing SQL scripts against your database).

First download the script(s) from the [http://code.google.com/p/biolink/downloads/list downloads] area.

Start Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, and connect to the server which holds your BioLink database.

Navigate to where you saved the downloaded scripts, and select which script you would like to execute (one at a time).

You must then select which database you would like to execute this script against. Use the drop down list in the toolbar to selected your !BioLink database.

== !BioLink Web Extensions ==

*Priority:* _Optional_. Although this update is not necessary, it adds features that improve and simplify using the Query Tool.

This script adds:
  * new columns to the biota table which hold specific rank values of each taxons parentage (Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species, Subspecies)
  * new columns to the Political Region table (ParentCountry, Primary Division and Secondary Division)
  * two new views (DarwinCareV2 and APPDV2)
  * A number of user defined functions and triggers to support the above changes.

== !AssociateReportsPatch ==

*Priority:* _Recommended_. It is highly likely that the Associates for Taxa report will not return any results unless this patch has been applied.

This script addresses an issue in the stored procedure used by the Associates For Taxa report that, on some installations, will cause incorrect or no results to be returned.
